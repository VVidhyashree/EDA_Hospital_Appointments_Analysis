# EDA_Hospital_Appointments_Analysis

The following insights summarize the primary factors influencing patient No-Show rates in the medical appointment dataset:
1. 👫 Patient Demographics
   
#Gender Distribution,Female patients account for a significantly higher volume of appointments than male patients overall.
#Age & Attendance,"Attendance is consistently high across almost all age groups, with approximately an 80% Show Rate for every group. The highest show rates are observed in the Age 0 (Infants) and Age 1 groups."
#Location Impact,"The Neighbourhood variable appears to have little discriminatory power, as nearly every area maintains a consistently high 80% Show Rate.

2. ⚕️ Health and Assistance Factors
These findings highlight the counter-intuitive relationships between specific conditions and appointment attendance:

#Hypertension,Patients with Hypertension (85% Show Rate) are significantly more likely to attend than those without (78% Show Rate).,A diagnosed chronic condition appears to drive higher compliance.
#Diabetes,Patients with Diabetes (83% Show Rate) are slightly more likely to attend than those without (80% Show Rate).,"Similar to Hypertension, a chronic diagnosis correlates with better attendance."
#Scholarship,Patients without a Scholarship (80% Show Rate) have a slightly higher attendance rate than those with a Scholarship (75% Show Rate).,Financial aid status does not guarantee higher attendance; other factors may outweigh the benefit.

3. 📱 Communication & Scheduling

#SMS Received,Patients who did NOT receive an SMS have a much higher Show Rate (84%) than those who did (72%).
#Scheduling Day,Appointments are strictly scheduled and held Monday through Friday. There are very few appointments on Saturday and zero appointments on Sunday.
